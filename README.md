## AWS Cloud
 - AWS Global Infrastructure:
   - AWS Regions: clusters of data centers (Most AWS services are region-scoped)
   - AWS Availability Zones
   - AWS Data Centers
   - AWS Edge Locations /Points of Presence
 - How to choose an AWS Region?
   - Compliance with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
   - Proximity to customers: reduced latency
   - Available services within a Region: new services and new features aren’t available in every Region
   - Pricing: pricing varies from region to region and is transparent on the service pricing page
 - AWS Availability Zones: (min-3, max-6 per region, each AZ has one or more discrete data centers (separated))
 - AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations): Content is delivered to end users with lower latency
 - services:
   - Global: IAM, Route53, Cloudfront, WAF
   - Region(most services): EC2(IaaS), Elastic Beanstalk(PaaS), Lambda(FaaS), Rekognition(SaaS)

## AWS IAM
 - Users and Groups: Root Account, Users and Groups(only contain users)
 - IAM-Permissions: JSON files called policies -- apply the privilege principle, don't give more permissions than a user needs.
 - IAM policies inheritance: users who belong to multiple groups can inherit multiple permissions
 - IAM policies structure: version(required), id(optional), statement(required)
   - statement: Sid(statement id--optional),Effect(allow/deny), Principal(to whom this policy applied to), Action(list of allow/deny), Resource(list of resources the actions applied to), Condition(conditions for when this policy takes effect)
 - IAM password policy
   - strong password = high security
   - password policy:
     - min length
     - specific char types
     - allow all iam users to change their passwords
     - password expiration
     - prevent password re-use
 - Multi-Factor Authentication - MFA: Password + MFA = Successful Login
 - How can users access AWS?
   - AWS Console (password + MFA)
   - AWS CLI(access key): alternative to AWS Console
   - AWS SDK(access key)
   - access key id & access key secret (don't share access keys)
 - IAM Roles for Services: an IAM role contains IAM permissions will be assigned to certain AWS services to perform some actions
 - IAM Security Tools:
   - IAM Credentials Report (account-level): a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials
   - IAM Access Advisor (user-level): Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed. You can use this information to revise your policies.
## EC2 Basics
 - EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure as a Service
 - EC2: renting virtual machine (EC2), storing data on virtual drives(EBS), distributing traffic across machines(ELB), Scaling (ASG)
 - EC2 sizing & configuration options:
   - OS: Linux, Windows, MacOS
   - CPU & RAM
   - storage: instance store(hardware), network-attached (EBS&EFS)
   - Network card: speed of the card, public IP
   - Firewall rules: security group
   - Bootstrap script (configure at first launch): EC2 User Data
     - launching commands when an EC2 instance starts (only first start, run once)
     - install software, updates, download files from internet or something else
     - user data script runs with root user
 - EC2 instance type:
   - naming convention: m5.2xlarge (m instance class, 5 generation, 2xlarge size within the instance class)
   - general purpose: great for a diversity of workloads such as web servers or code repositories, which strike the balance between compute, memory, and network
   - compute optimized: great for compute-intensive tasks that require high-performance CPUs: Batch processing, media transcoding, gaming server, machine learning.
   - memory optimized: great for processing large data sets in memory: real-time processing big unstructured data, BI, high-performance database
   - storage optimized: great for storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage: Data warehousing applications, High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems.
 - Security Groups(stateful, NACL--stateless):  fundamental of network security in AWS,  control how traffic is allowed into or out of our EC2 Instances.
   - only contain rules
   - Security groups rules can reference by IP or by security group
     - ports
     - IP ranges - IPV4 / IPV6
     - inbound / outbound
   - can be attached to multiple instances
   - locked down to region/VPC
   - live outside of EC2
   - good to maintain a separated security group for SSH
 - Classic Ports: 22-SSH, 21-FTP, 22-Sftp, 80-HTTP, 443-HTTPS, 3389-RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) – log into a Windows instance
 - SSH: one of the most important function. It allows you to control a remote machine, all using the command line.
 - EC2 Instance Connect: no need for access key file, open within a browser, a temporary key will be used (only works with aws linux2), and make sure to open port 22
 - EC2 Instances Purchasing Options:
   - On-Demand Instances – short-term and un-interrupted workload, predictable pricing, pay by second and for what you use
   - Reserved (1 & 3 years): 
     - Reserved Instances – long workloads, save up to 72% compared to on-demand , instance's scope -- regional or zonal, long-term and steady workloads, such as database
     - Convertible Reserved Instances – long workloads with flexible instances, save up to 66% compared to on-demand (can change instance type, family, OS, scope and tenancy)
   - Savings Plans (1 & 3 years): save up to 72%, locked down to instance family and region – a commitment to an amount of usage, long workload
   - Spot Instances: save up to 90%, most cost-effient – short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable), great for workloads that are resilient to failure(such as batch job, data analysis, any distributed job, image processing, etc), but not for critical jobs
   - Dedicated Hosts – book an entire physical server, control instance placement, allows to address compliance requirements and use existing server-bound software licenses. Most expensive, on-demand/reserved(1 or 3 yrs)
   - Dedicated Instances – no other customers will share your hardware, but may share hardware with other instances in the same account. The hardware is dedicated to you, no control over instance placement.
   - Capacity Reservations – reserve on-demand instances capacity in a **specific AZ** for any duration
 - Which purchasing option is right for me?
   - On-demand: coming and staying in resort whenever we like, we pay the full price
   - Reserved: like planning ahead and if we plan to stay for a long time, we may get a good discount.
   - Savings Plans: pay a certain amount per hour for certain period and stay in any room type (e.g., King, Suite, Sea View, …)
   - Spot instances: the hotel allows people to bid for the empty rooms and the highest bidder keeps the rooms. You can get kicked out at any time
   - Dedicated Hosts: We book an entire building of the resort
   - Capacity Reservations: you book a room for a period with full price even you don’t stay in it
 - EC2 Spot Instance Requests: define **max spot price** , when **current spot price** > **max spot price**, can choose to **stop** or **terminate** with 2 min grace period. Or **Spot Block** to **block** the instances during a specified time frame with interruptions.
 - How to terminate Spot Instances? you must first cancel a **spot request**, and then terminate the associated spot instances.
 - Spot Fleets: a set of spot instances + (optional)on-demand instances
   - trying to meet the target capacity with price constraints(define launch pools)
   - strategies to allocate spot instances: lowestPrice, diversified, capacityOptimized, priceCapacityOptimized(recommended)
   - Spot Fleets allow us to automatically request Spot Instances with the lowest price
## EC2 Associate
 - Private vs public IP (IPV4)
   - public IP: machine can be identified on the internet, meaning it's unique across the internet and can be geo-located easily.
   - private IP: machine can only be identified on a private network, meaning it's unique across the private network, connecting to public internet via NAT and internet gateway. Besides, only a specified range of IPs can be used as private IPs
 - Elastic IP: a fixed public IP for your EC2 instance, can only be attached to one instance at a time.
   - can only have up to 5 Elastic IPs in your account (ask aws to increase)
   - can quickly remap the address to another instance when another was failed
   - Overall, try to avoid using Elastic IP: 1)often reflect poor architectural decisions. 2)instead, use a random public IP with a registered DNS name. 3)or using a load balancer.
 - by default, each EC2 instance has a public IP and a private IP
 - Placement Groups:
   - strategies: 1)Cluster—clusters instances into a low-latency group in a single Availability Zone. 2)Spread—spreads instances across underlying hardware (max 7 instances per group per AZ). 3)Partition—spreads instances across many different partitions (which rely on different sets of racks) within an AZ. Scales to 100s of EC2 instances per group (Hadoop, Cassandra, Kafka)
 - Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI): Logical component in a VPC that represents a virtual network card. Can be created independently and attach them on the fly on EC2 instances for failover. ENI is bound to specific AZ.
   - Primary private IPv4, one or more secondary IPv4
   - One Elastic IP (IPv4) per private IPv4
   - One Public IPv4
   - One or more security groups
   - A MAC address
 - EC2 Hibernate: 1)the RAM state is written into root EBS(must be encrypted). 2)long-running processing, services that take time to initialize
   - the instance RAM size must be less then **150GB**
   - cannot be in the state of hibernate more than **60 days**
   - available for **on-demand, spot** instance

 - CloudWatch Logs – S3 Export: take up to 12 hrs. API call(CreateExportTask). Not near-real-time or real-time… use Logs Subscriptions instead.
 - CloudWatch Logs Subscriptions:  get real-time logs from cloudwatch, and send to Kinesis Data Streams, Kinesis Data Firehose, or Lambda. **Subscription Filter(filter logs)**.
 - CloudWatch Logs AggregationMulti-Account & Multi-Region: [account1/region1...] -> [Subscription Filter...] -> Kinesis Data Streams -> Kinesis Data Firehose -> S3.
 - CloudWatch Logs Subscriptions: Cross-Account Subscription – send log events to resources in a different AWS account (KDS, KDF) (**in this case, we need modify the destination cloudwatch service's access policy to accept the logs from the original cloudwatch service. meanwhile, we need a IAM role to allow kinesis data streams to collect logs**)
 - CloudWatch Logs for EC2: we need **cloudwatch logs agent** running on the EC2 instances with proper IAM permissions.
 - CloudWatch Logs Agent & Unified Agent: logs agent -- old version, can only send logs to cloudwatch. unified agent -- collect and send logs as well as additional system-level metrics such as RAM, CPU. Centralized configuration using SSM Parameter Store.
 - CloudWatch Unified Agent – Metrics : CPU, RAM, DISK metrics, Netstat, processes, swap space(free, used)

## AWS IAM Advanced
## AWS Security and Encryption
## AWS VPC
 - Understanding CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) – IPv4: Base IP and Subnet Mask
 - private vs public IP (IPV4)
   - private IP: 10.0.0.0/8 (big networks), 172.16.0.0/12 (AWS default VPC), 192.168.0.0/16 (home networks)'
   - All the rest of the IP addresses on the Internet are public
 - Default VPC: new EC2 instances launched in default VPC if no subnet specified, has internet connectivity and ec2 instances have public ips, private or public DNS names.
 - VPC in AWS – IPv4
   - multiple VPCs in an AWS region (max. 5 per region – soft limit)
   - Max. CIDR per VPC is 5, for each CIDR:
     - Min. size is /28 (16 IP addresses)
     - Max. size is /16 (65536 IP addresses)
   - Because VPC is private, only the Private IPv4 ranges are allowed
   - Your VPC CIDR should **NOT overlap** with your other networks (e.g.,corporate)
 - VPC – Subnet (IPv4)
   - AWS reserves 5 IP addresses (first 4 & last 1) in each subnet
 - Internet Gateway (IGW): at the VPC level, provide IPv4 & IPv6 Internet Access
 - Route Tables: must be edited to add routes from subnets to the IGW, VPC Peering Connections, VPC Endpoints, …
 - Bastion Host:  public EC2 instance to SSH into, that has SSH connectivity to EC2 instances in private subnets
 - NAT Instances: gives Internet access to EC2 instances in private subnets. Old, must be setup in a public subnet, disable Source / Destination check flag
 - NAT Gateway – managed by AWS, provides scalable Internet access to private EC2 instances, IPv4 only
 - NACL – stateless, subnet rules for inbound and outbound, don’t forget Ephemeral Ports
 - Security Groups – stateful, operate at the EC2 instance level
 - VPC Peering – connect two VPCs with non overlapping CIDR, non-transitive
 - VPC Endpoints: Interface endpoint( Provisions an ENI (private IP address) as an entrypoint (must attach a Security Group), S2S VPN, Direct Connect, different VPC) , Gateway endpoint( free, S3 and DynamoDB)
 - VPC Flow Logs: can be setup at the VPC / Subnet / ENI Level, for ACCEPT and REJECT traffic, helps identifying attacks, analyze using Athena or CloudWatch Logs Insights
 - Site-to-Site VPN – setup a Customer Gateway on DC, a Virtual Private Gateway on VPC, and site-to-site VPN over public Internet
 - AWS VPN CloudHub – hub-and-spoke VPN model to connect your sites
 - Direct Connect – setup a Virtual Private Gateway on VPC, and establish a direct private connection to an AWS Direct Connect Location
 - Direct Connect Gateway – setup a Direct Connect to many VPCs in different AWS regions
 - AWS PrivateLink / VPC Endpoint Services:
   - Connect services privately from your service VPC to customers VPC
   - Doesn’t need VPC Peering, public Internet, NAT Gateway, Route Tables
   - Must be used with Network Load Balancer & ENI
 - ClassicLink – connect EC2-Classic EC2 instances privately to your VPC
 - Transit Gateway – transitive peering connections for VPC, VPN & DX
 - Traffic Mirroring – copy network traffic from ENIs for further analysis
 - Egress-only Internet Gateway – like a NAT Gateway, but for IPv6 (doesn't allow the outside network to initialize the connection first)
 - Networking Costs in AWS per GB - Simplified
   - Use Private IP instead of Public IP for good savings and better network performance
   - Use same AZ for maximum savings (at the cost of high availability)
   - free for traffic-in and server-private-server(or EC2) in the same AZ, cost a little for AZ-1 -private- AZ-2, cost a bit more for AZ-1 -public- AZ-2, cost more for Region-1 -public- REgion-2
 - Minimizing egress traffic network cost
   - Try to keep as much internet traffic within AWS to minimize costs
   - outbound traffic free
   - Direct Connect location that are co-located in the same AWS Region result in lower cost for egress network
 - S3 Data Transfer Pricing – Analysis for USA
   - ingress free
   - to internet : 0.09$/GB
   - transfer acceleration with edge locations: +0.04$/GB - 0.08$/GB
   - cloudFront: 0.085$/GB (slightly cheaper): caching, reduce cost associated with S3 requests
   - cross-region: 0.02$/GB
 - Pricing: NAT Gateway vs Gateway VPC Endpoint
   - for private subnet EC2 instances, VPC endpoint can save a lot (for S3, using gateway endpoint:free, only charge for data transfer)
 - Network Protection on AWS
   - Network Access Control Lists (NACLs)
   - Amazon VPC security groups
   - AWS WAF (protect against malicious requests)
   - AWS Shield & AWS Shield Advanced
   - AWS Firewall Manager (to manage them across accounts)

     - supports 1000 rules: IP &port, Protocol, stateful domain list, general pattern using regex
     - Traffic filtering: Allow, drop, or alert for the traffic that matches the rules
     - Active flow inspection to protect against network threats with intrusion-prevention capabilities (like Gateway Load Balancer, but all managed by AWS)
     - Send logs of rule matches to Amazon S3, CloudWatch Logs, Kinesis Data Firehose
## Disaster Recovery and Migration
 - Overview:
   - Disaster recovery (DR) is about preparing for and recovering from a disaster
   - types of DR:
     - On-premise => On-premise: traditional DR, and very expensive
     - On-premise => AWS Cloud: hybrid recovery
     - AWS Cloud Region A => AWS Cloud Region B
   - RPO(Recovery Point Objective -- data lose) and RTO (Recovery Time Objective -- down time)
   - Disaster Recovery Strategies
     - Backup and Restore (High RPO, either AWS storage gateway and snow family or schedule regular snapshots)
     - Pilot Light (core functionality is always running, such as database) -- data replication
     - Warm Standby (minimal version of full system is running, quickly to scale up ) -- data replication
     - Hot Site / Multi Site Approach (very low RTO, pricy, full production scale is always running on-prem and AWS)
   - DR Tips:
     - Backup
       - EBS or RDS snapshots/backups, etc
       - regular push to S3/ S3 IA/ Glacier, lifecycle policy, cross-region replication
       - from on-premise: snowball or storage gateway
     - High Availability
       - use Route53 to migrate DNS from region to region
       - RDS multi-AZ, elastiCache multi-AZ, EFS, S3
       - S2S VPN as failover for Direct Connect
     - Replication
       - RDS cross-region replica, Aurora + global database
       - storage gateway
       - on-prem DB to RDS
     - Automation
       - CloudFormation/ Elastic Beanstalk to re-create a whole new env
       - recover EC2 instances when Cloudwatch alarms
       - Lambda functions for customized automation
     - chaos
       - Netflix has a “simian-army” randomly terminating EC2
 - DMS – Database Migration Service: Quickly and securely migrate databases to AWS, resilient, self-healing
   - The source database remains available during the migration
   - an EC2 instance is a must for running DMS
   - Continuous Data Replication using CDC
   - supports: Homogeneous migrations / Heterogeneous migrations
   - Source and Target: take a DB and export or import it onto any DBs that AWS supports
   - AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)
     - Convert your Database’s Schema from one engine to another
     - You do not need to use SCT if you are migrating the same DB engine
   - DMS - Continuous Replication: install and setup SCT(schema convertion tool) on-prem to convert the schema, and have an EC2 instance with DMS and CDC(change data capture) installed to do continuous replication
   - AWS DMS – Multi-AZ Deployment
     - When Multi-AZ Enabled, DMS provisions and maintains a synchronous stand replica in a different AZ
     - Advantages:
       - provider data redundancy
       - eliminate I/O freeze
       - minimize latency spike
 - RDS & Aurora MySQL Migrations
   - RDS MySQL to Aurora MySQL
     - Option 1: DB Snapshots from RDS MySQL restored as MySQL Aurora DB
     - Option 2: Create an Aurora Read Replica from your RDS MySQL, and when the replication lag is 0, promote it as its own DB cluster (can take time and cost $)
   - External MySQL to Aurora MySQL
     - Option 1: use Percona Xtrabackup to create a backup file in S3, then import the file into Aurora
     - Option 2: create Aurora mysql DB, then use the **mysqldump** utility to migrate Mysql to Aurora (slower than S3)
   - Use DMS if both databases are up and running
 - RDS & Aurora PostgreSQL Migrations
   - RDS PostgreSQL to Aurora PostgreSQL : similar to how migrate RDS mysql to Aurora myssql
   - External PostgreSQL to Aurora PostgreSQL: create a backup file in S3, then import it into Aurora postgres using **aws_s3 Aurora extension**
   - Use DMS if both databases are up and running
 - On-Premise strategy with AWS
   - Ability to download Amazon Linux 2 AMI as a VM (.iso format): VMWare, KVM, VirtualBox (Oracle VM), Microsoft Hyper-V.
   - VM Import / Export: Migrate existing applications into EC2. Create a DR repository strategy for your on-premises VMs. Can export back the VMs from EC2 to on-premises.
   - AWS Application Discovery Service: gather info on on-prem servers to plan a migration. Server utilization and dependency mappings. Track with AWS Migration Hub
   - AWS Database Migration Service (DMS): works with various DBs, can do on-prem <--> AWS, AWS <--> AWS
   - AWS Server Migration Service (SMS): Incremental replication of on-premises live servers to AWS
 - AWS Backup (fully managed, no need for custom script or manual process)
   - Centrally manage and automate backups across AWS services
   - support cross-account / cross-region backups
   - support many services
   - Supports PITR for supported services
   - On-Demand and Scheduled backups
   - Tag-based backup policies
   - You create backup policies known as Backup Plans: backup frequency, backup window, transition to cold storage, retention period
 - AWS Backup Vault Lock (Backup Vault Lock Policy)
   - Enforce a WORM (Write Once Read Many) state for all the backups that you store in your AWS Backup Vault
   - Additional layer of defense to protect your backups against
   - Even the root user cannot delete backups when enabled
 - AWS Application Discovery Service + AWS Application Migration Service (MGN)
   - Plan migration projects by gathering information about on-premises data centers. Server utilization data and dependency mapping are important for migrations
   - Agentless Discovery (AWS Agentless Discovery Connector) / Agent-based Discovery (AWS Application Discovery Agent)
   - Resulting data can be viewed within AWS Migration Hub
   - Lift-and-shift (rehost) solution which simplify migrating applications to AWS
   - Converts your physical, virtual, and cloud-based servers to run natively on AWS (staging: low-cost EC2 instances & EBS volumes, then perform a cutover to switch to production: target EC2 instances and EBS volumes)
   - Supports wide range of platforms, Operating Systems, and databases
   - Minimal downtime, reduced costs
 - Transferring large amount of data into AWS
   - Example: transfer 200 TB of data in the cloud. We have a 100 Mbps internet connection.
   - 1)Over the internet / Site-to-Site VPN: quick setup, but takes very long time
   - 2)Over direct connect 1Gbps: long time to setup(more than 1 month), much quicker than the first way
   - 3)Over Snowball: Will take 2 to 3 snowballs in parallel and take about 1 week for e2e transfer, and can be combined with DMS
   - 4)For on-going replication / transfers: Site-to-Site VPN or DX with DMS or DataSync
 - VMware Cloud on AWS
   - Some customers use VMware Cloud to manage their on-premises Data Center. They want to extend the Data Center capacity to AWS, but keep using the VMware Cloud software. Enter VMware Cloud on AWS
   - use cases: Migrate your VMware vSphere-based workloads to AWS
   - Run your production workloads across VMware vSphere-based private, public, and hybrid cloud environments
   - Have a disaster recover strategy
