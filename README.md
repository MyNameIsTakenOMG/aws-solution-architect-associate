## AWS Cloud
 - AWS Global Infrastructure:
   - AWS Regions: clusters of data centers (Most AWS services are region-scoped)
   - AWS Availability Zones
   - AWS Data Centers
   - AWS Edge Locations /Points of Presence
 - How to choose an AWS Region?
   - Compliance with data governance and legal requirements: data never leaves a region without your explicit permission
   - Proximity to customers: reduced latency
   - Available services within a Region: new services and new features arenâ€™t available in every Region
   - Pricing: pricing varies from region to region and is transparent on the service pricing page
 - AWS Availability Zones: (min-3, max-6 per region, each AZ has one or more discrete data centers (separated))
 - AWS Points of Presence (Edge Locations): Content is delivered to end users with lower latency
 - services:
   - Global: IAM, Route53, Cloudfront, WAF
   - Region(most services): EC2(IaaS), Elastic Beanstalk(PaaS), Lambda(FaaS), Rekognition(SaaS)

## AWS IAM
 - Users and Groups: Root Account, Users and Groups(only contain users)
 - IAM-Permissions: JSON files called policies -- apply the privilege principle, don't give more permissions than a user needs.
 - IAM policies inheritance: users who belong to multiple groups can inherit multiple permissions
 - IAM policies structure: version(required), id(optional), statement(required)
   - statement: Sid(statement id--optional),Effect(allow/deny), Principal(to whom this policy applied to), Action(list of allow/deny), Resource(list of resources the actions applied to), Condition(conditions for when this policy takes effect)
 - IAM password policy
   - strong password = high security
   - password policy:
     - min length
     - specific char types
     - allow all iam users to change their passwords
     - password expiration
     - prevent password re-use
 - Multi-Factor Authentication - MFA: Password + MFA = Successful Login
 - How can users access AWS?
   - AWS Console (password + MFA)
   - AWS CLI(access key): alternative to AWS Console
   - AWS SDK(access key)
   - access key id & access key secret (don't share access keys)
 - IAM Roles for Services: an IAM role contains IAM permissions will be assigned to certain AWS services to perform some actions
 - IAM Security Tools:
   - IAM Credentials Report (account-level): a report that lists all your account's users and the status of their various credentials
   - IAM Access Advisor (user-level): Access advisor shows the service permissions granted to a user and when those services were last accessed. You can use this information to revise your policies.
